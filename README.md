#Django User Examples

A couple of projects with examples of different user models. Each project has a simple app which gives the user two choices to choose between. There isn't a specific purpose for this app except to give the user something to interact with.

For convenience, each example uses sqlite3 for its database.

Initial data can be loaded from the `fixture_data.json` file.

```
python manage.py loaddata ../fixture_data.json
```
